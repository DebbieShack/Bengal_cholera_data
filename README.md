# Bengal_cholera_data
Historical (1891-1941) Cholera Mortality Dataset covering British Bengal. Data were manually transcribed from 'Annual Reports of the Sanitary Commissioner of Bengal'. Mortality data are divided into the following districts:

Burdwan
Birbhum
Bankura
Midnapur
Hooghly
Howrah

24-Parganas
Calcutta
Nadia
Murshidabad
Jessore
Khulna

Rajshahi
Dinajpur
Jalpaiguri
Darjeeling
Rangpur
Bogra
Pabna
Malda

Dacca
Mymensingh
Faridpur
Bakarganj

Chittagong
Noakhali
Tippera

I have also included decadal census data (population file), data describing the vaccination programme (vaccination file), and some images of the original text for context. While transcribing errors remain possible, they were minimized by verifying the column sums with the totals given in the texts. 

Data is without copywrite and free to use, but for my own personal interest - please send me an email if you do end up using it (email below).
If you have any other questions - please email dmshackleton@gmail.com
